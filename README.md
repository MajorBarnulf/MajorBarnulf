Hi, I am Matthieu JOLIMAITRE, a French computer science student.
I am studdying at EPITA/Toulouse, I am mainly interested in embeded and performance computing.

---

I mainly develop in Rust or typescript under [deno](https://deno.land/) because these are the languages I prefer for their conciseness and IDE support.
